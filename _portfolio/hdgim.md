This project implements a high-dimensional representation and matching framework for genome-like sequences in Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to explore how hyperdimensional or high-dimensional computing ideas can be applied to efficient sequence encoding and similarity search.

The repository includes:
- **Sequence encoding and matching logic** (e.g., high-dimensional representations for DNA-like sequences).
- **Dataset handling utilities** for loading, transforming, and managing sequence data.
- **Exploratory notebooks** for visualization and evaluation of matching behavior.

This project serves as a research prototype for high-dimensional sequence processing and anomaly-like pattern discovery, and connects to my broader interest in reliable and privacy-aware intelligent sensing.
