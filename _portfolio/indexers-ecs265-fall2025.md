This project is a course project for ECS265 at UC Davis, built on top of the Apache ResilientDB codebase. The main objective is to understand how indexing and querying can be designed for a fault-tolerant, permissioned blockchain/distributed database system.

Key aspects of the project include:
- **Forking and extending ResilientDB** as a playground for experimentation with index structures.
- Setting up the build and deployment environment to run local experiments on replicated ledgers.
- Exploring how **indexers and search mechanisms** can be integrated into a consensus-based, replicated data store for more efficient query processing.

Through this work, I gained hands-on experience with large-scale distributed systems codebases and the practical challenges of adding new functionality (such as indexes) while preserving reliability and consistency guarantees.
