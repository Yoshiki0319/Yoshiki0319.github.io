I am an M.S. student in Computer Science at the University of California, Davis (expected graduation June 2027).  
My current academic interests focus on **medical AI**, **digital therapeutics**, and **data-driven methods for improving healthcare**. I am particularly interested in how machine learning can be used to build reliable, privacy-aware systems that support diagnosis, treatment, and continuous patient monitoring.

In the past, I was mainly interested in **LiDAR and 3D perception**, but through my research and internship experience I became increasingly fascinated by applications of AI to **human health** and **societal impact**. I am now looking to deepen my expertise in medical AI and digital therapeutics through intensive research in a laboratory setting.

### Research interests

My current research interests include:

- Medical AI and clinical decision support  
- Digital therapeutics and data-driven healthcare intervention  
- Semi-supervised and self-supervised learning for medical data  
- Reliability, robustness, and anomaly detection in real-world sensor and clinical data  
- Privacy-aware machine learning and trustworthy AI systems  

### Research experience

My previous research mainly explored **reliable perception and anomaly detection**, which I now hope to extend to medical and healthcare applications.

Most recently, I worked as an undergraduate researcher at Shibaura Institute of Technology, advised by Dr. Taku Yamazaki and Dr. Takumi Miyoshi. Our work focused on **interpolating anomalous frames in sequential LiDAR point cloud data** using point cloud prediction techniques. We investigated:

- real-time recursive point cloud prediction,  
- quantitative reliability assessment of 3D LiDAR data, and  
- initial evaluation of interpolation methods for anomalous frames.

These projects led to presentations and publications at venues such as the IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE 2025) and IEICE RISING, and gave me experience in designing experiments, implementing models, and evaluating reliability under real-world constraints.

I also worked as an undergraduate internship researcher in the **Bio-Inspired Architecture and Systems Laboratory** at the University of California, Irvine, advised by Dr. Mohsen Imani. There, I contributed to **PV-VTT**, a privacy-centric dataset for mission-specific anomaly detection and natural language interpretation. My work included:

- constructing and refining a dataset with privacy-sensitive content,  
- implementing **high-dimensional genome sequence encoding** and sequence matching in Python and PyTorch, and  
- experimenting with efficient implementations for large-scale sequence processing.

Through these experiences, I developed strong skills in **machine learning implementation**, **data handling**, and **reliability/anomaly analysis**—skills I now wish to apply to medical data and digital health applications.

Earlier in my undergraduate studies, I also worked on a data science project with Dr. Takuya Harada, using urban and population data to correct misallocated population statistics via residential land-use analysis. This project strengthened my ability to work with messy real-world datasets and motivated me to think about socially impactful applications of data science.

### Background and skills

I received my B.E. in Electronic Information Systems from Shibaura Institute of Technology in Japan, where I graduated in the Global Program with a GPA of 3.92/4.00, ranking 9th out of 116 students.

I primarily work with **Python**, and I have experience with:

- Machine learning frameworks: PyTorch  
- Scientific computing and data handling: NumPy, Pandas, SQLite  
- General programming: C, Java  
- Web/backend development: Flask, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Socket.IO  
- Version control: Git

To broaden my practical data science skills, I completed programs such as the Global Consumer Intelligence Course at the University of Tokyo and the Data Science Practical Course at Waseda University, where I worked on real-world data analysis and group projects.

### Awards and scholarships

I have been fortunate to receive several scholarships and awards, including:

- Study Abroad Scholarship, Saitama Prefecture (2025)  
- Best Session Presentation Award, IEEE 43rd International Conference on Consumer Electronics (2025)  
- Ganbare! Financial Support for Japanese University Students, KEYENCE Foundation (2023)  
- SI Tech Scholarship, Shibaura Institute of Technology (2022)  

These awards have supported my research activities and international study experiences.

### Current goals

My current goal is to engage in research on **medical AI and digital therapeutics**, especially projects that:

- leverage machine learning to support diagnosis and treatment,  
- incorporate robustness and anomaly handling for real-world clinical data, and  
- respect privacy and ethical constraints while still providing practical value.
