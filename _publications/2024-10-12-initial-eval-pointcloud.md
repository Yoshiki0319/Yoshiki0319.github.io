Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, which can capture real-time 3D point cloud data as spatial information, play a crucial role in the autonomous control of vehicles and robots, as well as in the construction and maintenance of digital twins. However, attacks have been developed that exploit pulse waves to delete necessary points from or insert anomalous points into the point cloud data. These attacks can compromise the safety of autonomous systems and the reliability of digital twins by causing misinterpretations of spatial information and disrupting object recognition. In this presentation, we explore an approach to interpolate anomalous frames in time-series point cloud data obtained from a LiDAR sensor, utilizing a point cloud prediction algorithm. Additionally, we conduct an initial evaluation to assess the prediction accuracy of our approach in basic scenarios.
