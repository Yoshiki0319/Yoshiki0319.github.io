Physical attacks that target light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors have become a significant threat to the security and reliability of LiDAR-based systems, particularly in autonomous driving and digital twin applications. These attacks selectively manipulate or remove point cloud data, thereby undermining the functionality of safety-critical systems. In this study, we propose a recursive point cloud prediction mechanism that anticipates future frames based on past data, enabling real-time interpolation of anomalous frames. The proposed mechanism predicts five future frames based on the preceding five frames and replaces compromised frames with interpolated predictions, thereby ensuring data continuity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using a major dataset, showing that it can maintain data integrity even during physical attacks.
