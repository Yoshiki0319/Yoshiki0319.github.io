Synthetic population data may assign individuals to non-residential locations such as hospitals or public facilities when allocating them to dwellings. This issue arises because maps detailing building usage nationwide are unavailable due to copyright restrictions. This study plans to identify building usage by utilizing the Land Use Trends Survey, the Electronic National Land Basic Map (orthoimages), and standard maps, aiming to create usable maps that specify building purposes.
