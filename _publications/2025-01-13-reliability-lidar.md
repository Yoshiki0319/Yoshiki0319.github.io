Digital twin technology plays a crucial role in realizing advanced mobility services such as autonomous driving; however, it is at risk because of potential tampering with three-dimensional (3D) point cloud data collected by Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) systems. This paper proposes a method to detect tampering in 3D point cloud data based on LiDAR scan line characteristics and to estimate a reliability score for each frame. Specifically, our method detects lost regions by calculating the angular differences between adjacent collected points and then applies a sigmoid function to the number of detected missing points to assign a reliability score. In experiments using the proposed method, we evaluated the reliability of tampered data, including consecutive and random data losses, and confirmed that the consecutive data loss resulted in a lower reliability score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the data integrity for digital twins. The method holds promise for providing reliable 3D point cloud data in future implementations.
